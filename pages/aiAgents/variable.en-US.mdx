# Variable

Variables allow the introduction of dynamic elements in agent definitions. They can be used to store and update state information for the agent, or provide additional context information at runtime. Mo AI Studio supports various types of variable setters, including:

- Text setter: Used for inputting simple text information
- File setter: Allows uploading and reading file contents
- Directory setter: Used for selecting and reading entire directory structures
- URL setter: Can fetch content from a specified URL
- Date setter: Provides current date and time, supporting different time zones
