# Publish Custom Components

Although we don't currently have an official publishing platform, we're actively developing one, so stay tuned! ðŸ˜‚

## Future Publishing Platform

We are developing a dedicated publishing platform that will allow you to easily share and publish your custom components. Through this platform, you will be able to:

- Upload your custom setters, output processors, and agents
- Manage versions of your components
- Share your creations with the community
- Use components shared by others

We look forward to launching this platform in the near future, which will greatly enhance the extensibility and community collaboration of Mo AI Studio. Please stay tuned for our updates!

## Conclusion

Although we don't currently have an official publishing platform, you can already start creating and using custom components. We encourage you to explore and experiment, creating unique solutions for your specific needs.

We will notify you as soon as our publishing platform is ready. In the meantime, if you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact our support team.

Thank you for your support of Mo AI Studio!
